<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a command-line interface program that demonstrates the simplicity and capability of multithreading/concurrency techniques in the Java language.
It allows any computer to simulate and play the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock against itself.

This program uses multiple threads and the principles of OOP to simulate "simultaneous play", as would occur in a real-life game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.

It features two separate simulated AI players (each running on a separate thread) which each decide on a random move to play, before counting down and throwing
their move independently of each other.

Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock for more information on the game itself.


### Built With

- [Java](https://www.java.com/)

### Features

- Use of multithreading/concurrency to allow for simultaneous play
- Demonstration of Java OOP features and principles, as well as enumerated types, switch statements, and package management
- Command line output and statistics being held in a primary (separate from the players) thread provides ample opportunity for GUI overlay and statistics generation
- Calculation of each player's moves separately, including the option to set the random seed for each player (via manipulation of source code)

## Installation

1. Download the repository files (project) from the download section or clone this project by typing in the bash the following command:

       git clone https://github.com/afreemanio/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock-Simulator.git
2. Import it into Intellij IDEA or your Java IDE of choice
3. Run the application

Alternatively, to run it with the command line only:

1. Download the repository files (project) from the download section or clone this project by typing in the bash the following command:

2. Navigate to the repository using your terminal of choice


3. With Java installed, run the command 
   
        javac -d . *.java 
    to compile the package

4. Run the command 
   
        java rockPaperScissorLizardSpock.RockPaperScissorLizardSpock
   to run the program
